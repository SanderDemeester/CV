Hello,

I was referred to you through a friend (Jeroen De Wachter). He was in
contact with one of your colleagues (Jelche Lievens) earlier.
I was told you were responsible for recruitment concerning IT security?

My name is Sander Demeester, I am 23 years old and just ended my studies at
Ghent University. I was hoping you could give me some information on how to
find a fitting  job. I've added my resume as an attachment to this email. It
should provide some more detailed information about what knowledge I
possess. Below is a brief overview of myself and some general information
and what types of things are of interest to me.

One thing I should mention is that I have autism, which has its downsides,
mainly that I have a strong focus on perfection and when I start something I
get really into what I'm doing.
Jelche mentioned your firm has recruited people with Autism before and has
had good experiences though?
I can of course provide more information about my condition if required.

I really enjoy working on security infrastructure, setting up servers,
configuring routers and firewalls. Throughout my 3 years at Ghent University
and in my spare time, security and cryptography have been a big topic of
interest, both from a programming perspective as from a system architect
perspective. In my spare time I try to gain more knowledge about
security-related algorithms and protocols by implementing them in different
programming languages. I also attend IT-related conferences (like FOSDEM and
BruCON) and read IEEE and ACM papers relating to IT security.
More generally speaking, my interests are number theory and maths. I also
have a blog where I talk about cryptography algorithms and number theory
(http://sanderdemeester.be/blog/).

Naturally, I would like to find a job in this field and hope you might be
able to help out with that.
For the moment I'm an intern at Ghent University, working with the High
Performance Computing Infrastructure group. This internship will end
mid-august.

Thank you for reading my email and considering me.

Kind regards,
Sander Demeester
